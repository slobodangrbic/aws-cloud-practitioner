# Types of Cloud Computing

Cloud computing is broadly categorized into three types based on service models and four types based on deployment models. Here's an overview:

---

## **Service Models**

1. **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):**
   - Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet.
   - Includes services like virtual machines, storage, and networks.
   - Allows users to manage and control the infrastructure.
   - **Examples:** AWS EC2, Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines, Google Compute Engine.

2. **Platform as a Service (PaaS):**
   - Offers a platform and environment for developers to build, deploy, and manage applications without worrying about infrastructure.
   - Provides tools and frameworks for development.
   - **Examples:** Heroku, Google App Engine, Microsoft Azure App Service.

3. **Software as a Service (SaaS):**
   - Delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis.
   - Managed entirely by the provider, including maintenance and updates.
   - **Examples:** Google Workspace (Docs, Sheets, Gmail), Microsoft 365, Salesforce.

4. **Function as a Service (FaaS):**
   - Often categorized under serverless computing.
   - Allows developers to run specific functions or pieces of code without managing servers.
   - **Examples:** AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, Google Cloud Functions.

## **Deployment Models**

1. **Public Cloud:**
   - Resources are owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider and delivered over the internet.
   - Shared infrastructure is used by multiple organizations or customers.
   - **Examples:** AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure.

2. **Private Cloud:**
   - Resources are used exclusively by a single organization.
   - Provides greater control and customization.
   - Can be hosted on-premises or by a third-party provider.
   - **Examples:** VMware, OpenStack-based private clouds.

3. **Hybrid Cloud:**
   - Combines public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared between them.
   - Offers flexibility and optimizes existing infrastructure.
   - **Example Use Case:** Sensitive workloads on a private cloud and general-purpose workloads on a public cloud.

4. **Community Cloud:**
   - Shared infrastructure for specific organizations with similar goals, policies, or compliance requirements.
   - Typically managed collectively or by a third party.
   - **Example Use Case:** Government agencies with shared compliance needs.

These types can be tailored to meet specific business requirements, offering varying levels of control, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness.
